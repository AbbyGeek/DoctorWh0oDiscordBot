# Doctor Who Discord Bot!

Once upon a time, there was a DnD familiar who spent many years being the familiar of numerous player characters. during their travels, they learned alot about the different spells in Dnd 5e.
This bot is a reference bot for players and DMs alike. As of right now, most generic spells in the game are queriable and will return spell cards with relevant information.
